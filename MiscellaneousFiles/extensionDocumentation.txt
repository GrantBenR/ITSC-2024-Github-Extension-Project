Application flow of the extension:

-User loads browser
-User loads extension
-User goes to correct page
-User reloads page to activate extension
-Extension creates buttons and display
-Extension injects instances of these into the page at a destination div
-Extension checks if a log has been created for the current user, 
-If it hasn't it creates one and stores the log div in localstorage
-User hits start button on timer
-Extension finds the log for the current user from localStorage;
-Extension enters data into the textarea for the log comment
-Extension enables the submit button
-Extension refreshes the browser to submit the comment/update
-Extension saves the data from the timer to localStorage 
-After refresh, timer loads saved data to bring back the timer as it was
-User stops or pauses the timer
-Extension does the same song and dance to update the log with the end/pause date
